# Challenge 4: Print a table with all multiplications from 1 to 10.

We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-4. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

Create a function that calculates the sum of an array. You can use an arrays on your own but make sure that it you have arrays with negative integers and decimal values.

Constraints: You are not allowed to use the reduce or sum functions provided by JavaScript. Come up with your own solution.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Make your solution reusable so that it works with an abitrary arrays.

# Bonus II

Instead of an array, we have a table. Create a function that calculates the column or a row.
