# Challenge 3: Create a length converter

We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-3. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'.

You will create a length converter in this assignment. Start by converting kilometers to miles and vice versa.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Add more functionality to your solution. Add more units like yards and meters and take in the unit that should be converted as a parameter.

# Bonus II

Make your solution interactible with the HTML file.
