# Challenge 5: Reverse an array

We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-5. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

In this challenge, you will create an array and reverse it without using the built-in functions of JavaScript. Log the result to the console.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Make your solution reusable so that it works with an abitrary array.

# Bonus II

Make your solution interactible with the HTML file.
