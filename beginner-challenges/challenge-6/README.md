# Challenge 6: Sort an array
We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-6. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

This challenge is about sorting an array. Create an array with numbers and sort it from lowest to highest. Print the result to the console when you are done.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Make your solution work with sorting it from lowest to highest and from highest to lowest.
