# Challenge 8: Remove spaces form a string.
We are using the branch haroon-khanday for this assignment and the root branch for these tutorials. Make sure, you are branching from the correct branch.

Use git to create the branch haroon-beginner-2. The command for creating and switching to the new branch is 'git checkout -b <branch-name>'. 

In this challenge, you will create a table with the results of all multiplication of 1 to 10 (The first element in the table is 1 and the last 100). Log the output to the console, so you can check it up in the browser.

When you are finished, create a pull request on Github for haroon-khandey.

# Bonus I

Make your solution reusable so that it works with an abitrary string.

# Bonus II

Make your solution interactible with the HTML file.
